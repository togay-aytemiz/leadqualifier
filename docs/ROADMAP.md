# WhatsApp AI Qualy — Roadmap

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-18 (Removed manual `Faturalama bölgesi / Billing region` selection from Organization settings and switched `Settings > Plans` currency resolution to automatic request-region detection: Turkey (`TR`) => `TRY`, non-TR => `USD`, with `Accept-Language` fallback when geo headers are unavailable. Added self-service contact-level data deletion flow in `Settings > Organization` with permanent-delete confirmation and backend cleanup for conversation-linked records. Hardened WhatsApp Meta OAuth scope set for new app credentials by removing unsupported `business_management` request on WhatsApp connect. Made WhatsApp OAuth asset selection tolerant to missing WABA `name` field in Graph responses, added phone-number edge hydration fallback for sparse WABA payloads, surfaced popup OAuth outcomes directly on Channels UI, forced OAuth permission re-request (`auth_type=rerequest`) to avoid stale grant reuse, and added env-based optional `business_management` scope toggle for accounts requiring `/me/businesses` fallback access. Fallback now uses `/me/businesses` on `Missing Permission` only when that toggle is enabled, preventing unavoidable invalid-scope loops on apps where `business_management` is unsupported.)

- [x] Set up environment variables
- [x] Codify agent workflow rules (always provide commit message)
- [x] Add subagent-driven-development skill for plan execution workflow
- [x] Use system fonts in app shell to avoid CI font-fetch issues

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] **Multi-Tenant Foundation**
  - [x] Create organization model
  - [x] Implement `organization_id` isolation
  - [x] Set up RLS policies
- [x] **Auth & User Management**
  - [x] Supabase Auth integration
  - [x] User-organization relationship
  - [x] Role-based access (admin, member)
  - [x] Signout redirect now resolves `register` URL from runtime request origin instead of static app URL env fallback

---

## Phase 2: Messaging Channels
- [x] **WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API)**
  - [x] Choose provider (Meta Cloud API selected for MVP)
  - [x] Finalize MVP scope (OAuth channel setup, inbound text-only, reactive replies only)
  - [x] Write WhatsApp integration design document (`docs/plans/2026-02-08-whatsapp-meta-cloud-mvp-design.md`)
  - [x] Webhook endpoint for incoming messages
  - [x] Outgoing message API
  - [x] OAuth connect flow (`/api/channels/meta/start` + `/api/channels/meta/callback`)
  - [x] One-click connect from channel card (no intermediate "continue with Meta" modal)
  - [x] OAuth error/status redirects return to current channels route using signed/safe `returnTo` path
  - [x] OAuth connect now opens in a dedicated popup window and pushes success/error status back to the main Channels page
  - [x] OAuth host resolution hardened for Netlify custom-domain deployments (configured app URL + forwarded host fallback)
  - [x] Popup return flow now preserves `meta_oauth_error` for direct diagnosis on Channels URL
  - [x] WhatsApp OAuth candidate discovery falls back from `/me/whatsapp_business_accounts` to business-edge lookup (`/me/businesses` + owned/client WABA edges)
  - [x] WhatsApp OAuth now requests only WhatsApp scopes (`whatsapp_business_management`, `whatsapp_business_messaging`) to avoid `Invalid Scopes: business_management` failures on newer Meta apps
  - [x] WhatsApp OAuth candidate selection no longer requires WABA `name`; connect flow now succeeds when Graph returns `id + phone_numbers` without `name`
  - [x] WhatsApp OAuth candidate hydration now fetches `/{waba_id}/phone_numbers` when nested `phone_numbers` is missing from WABA list responses
  - [x] Channels page now shows OAuth popup result feedback (`success` / failure reason) instead of silently returning with no visible status
  - [x] Meta OAuth authorize URL now enforces permission re-consent (`auth_type=rerequest`) and Graph errors include endpoint path in server logs for faster permission debugging
  - [x] WhatsApp OAuth supports env toggle `META_WHATSAPP_INCLUDE_BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT=1` to include `business_management` when required by `/me/businesses` fallback on certain Meta app setups
  - [x] WhatsApp fallback no longer forces `/me/businesses` on `Missing Permission` unless `META_WHATSAPP_INCLUDE_BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT=1`, so unsupported `business_management` apps fail on the real direct endpoint instead of looping into invalid-scope recovery
- [x] **Telegram (Sandbox)**
  - [x] Channel connect + webhook registration
  - [x] Incoming message webhook
  - [x] Outgoing message API

  - [x] Incoming message webhook
  - [x] Outgoing message API (reactive replies only)
  - [x] First bot reply starts only after inbound customer message
  - [x] One-click connect from channel card (no intermediate "continue with Meta" modal)
  - [x] OAuth popup flow mirrors WhatsApp and keeps main app context stable during Meta auth
  - [x] Channels card connect CTA is temporarily disabled and shown as `Çok Yakında` for non-connected orgs
- [x] **Facebook Messenger (Placeholder)**
  - [x] Added Channels settings card with `Çok Yakında` CTA (no backend integration in MVP)
  - [x] Placeholder card icon now uses `public/messenger.svg` and follows stacked row-card layout in Channels settings
- [x] **Shared Inbound AI Pipeline**
  - [x] Keep Telegram/WhatsApp/Instagram webhook routes separate
  - [x] Move inbound AI flow to shared pipeline function and reuse in WhatsApp + Instagram
- [x] **Message Handling Core**

  - [x] Required Fields has its own AI suggestions toggle and remains a dedicated section
  - [x] Skill/KB updates auto-generate Required Fields AI chips and dedupe against existing manual/AI fields
  - [x] KB/fallback replies include a smart required-fields follow-up question (Telegram + Simulator) when key intake details are missing (skill replies stay unchanged) and use the last 3 assistant replies to avoid repeated greetings

  - [x] Ensure latest message is included even with async writes
  - [x] Enforce locale-aware output language (TR/EN) for lead summary and extracted detail fields
  - [x] Include manual profile note with approved AI suggestions in extraction context
  - [x] Preserve previously extracted lead details when later turns omit fields (merge-on-update instead of destructive overwrite)

  - [ ] Manual overwrite UI for "Important info" values in Inbox (per field edit + save source tracking)
- [x] **Lead List UX**
  - [x] Mobile leads list now uses compact card rows with reduced spacing while preserving the existing desktop table layout
  - [x] Desktop leads table keeps status chips on a single line and truncates long contact names to a single line
  - [x] Required-intake values shown in Inbox "Important info" are now rendered consistently in Leads table/mobile rows via shared resolver logic

  - [x] Improve top-up modal option-row readability: larger right-column price text and vertical centering
