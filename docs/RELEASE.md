## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added new lead status `undetermined` (TR: `Belirsiz`) across extraction/UI flows, including migration `supabase/migrations/00056_leads_status_undetermined.sql` to extend `leads.status` constraint.
- Added localized status labels for `undetermined` in both Inbox and Leads dictionaries (`messages/en.json`, `messages/tr.json`) and wired admin/leads/inbox status maps to render them.
- Added role-aware lead-extraction context builder (`buildLeadExtractionConversationContext`) with test coverage so extraction can read recent `customer`/`owner`/`assistant` turns and resolve short confirmations (for example, `Evet`) against the preceding question.
- Added lead-service inference guard coverage in `src/lib/leads/extraction.test.ts` for greeting-only messages, explicit service mentions, and catalog-alias matches.
- Added conversation-list lead-status sync helper + tests (`src/components/inbox/conversationLeadStatus.ts`, `src/components/inbox/conversationLeadStatus.test.ts`) so left-pane lead chips stay aligned with latest lead state.
- Added footer section-link mapping helpers and tests in `qualy-lp` (`lib/footer-links.ts`, `lib/footer-links.test.ts`) for stable Product→homepage section routing.
- Added popup-based Meta OAuth channel connect flow for WhatsApp/Instagram in Channels settings, including postMessage handoff so popup completion returns status to the main page automatically.
- Added shared Meta OAuth origin resolver utility (`src/lib/channels/meta-origin.ts`) with tests to prioritize canonical app URL and gracefully fall back to forwarded/request origin.
- Added Meta OAuth WhatsApp discovery fallback logic that traverses `me/businesses` and business WABA edges when direct `/me/whatsapp_business_accounts` is unsupported for the logged-in user token.
- Added landing legal center infrastructure in `qualy-lp`: markdown source docs (`legal/terms.md`, `legal/privacy.md`), runtime legal routes (`/legal`, `/terms`, `/privacy`), shared legal shell/pages, and legal markdown parser utilities with Vitest coverage (`lib/legal-utils.ts`, `lib/legal.test.ts`).
- Added build-time legal manifest generation (`scripts/generate-legal-assets.mjs`) and `prebuild` hook to emit `public/legal_versions.json` from markdown frontmatter versions.

- Added password visibility toggles (show/hide) to both Sign In and Sign Up forms.
- Added shared password-recovery style helpers and tests (`src/components/auth/passwordRecoveryStyles.ts`, `src/components/auth/passwordRecoveryStyles.test.ts`) to keep Forgot/Reset visuals aligned with auth defaults.
- Added a required consent checkbox to Sign Up and localized copy keys for consent/password-visibility/language/auth-canvas labels in both EN/TR message catalogs.

- Settings page now supports mobile single-pane flow: tapping Ayarlar opens a dedicated `/settings` list first, then selected settings open as animated detail pages with mobile back navigation.
- Knowledge Base now supports mobile single-pane flow: the left knowledge sidebar is hidden on mobile and files render as touch-friendly cards.
- Leads page now renders a compact mobile-first card list (reduced spacing/margins) while preserving the existing desktop sortable table layout.
- Lead extraction now enforces locale-aware output language (TR/EN) for user-facing extracted fields, including lead summary and important-info values.

- Added platform admin planning docs for searchable organization switcher + tenant impersonation flow and admin organization details controls (`docs/plans/2026-02-07-platform-admin-org-switcher-implementation-plan.md`).
- Updated PRD and Roadmap to include planned platform admin scope: cross-org switcher, organization-level analytics columns, and premium/trial/quota management modules.
- Confirmed platform admin decisions: switched-org impersonation is read-only in tenant modules, quotas are visibility-only for now, and admin details will include both organization + profile layers (multi-profile-ready).

- Skills now support `Requires Human Handover` with read-only bot message preview and deep-link to AI Settings (`Human Escalation` section + handover message focus).
- AI Settings form now shows a dedicated divider above the Bot Name section for clearer section separation.
- Human escalation copy polish: TR label now uses `Kişi çıkarım skoru`, step title uses `Yetenek tabanlı devir`, and the locale helper text under bot message is removed.
- AI Settings sensitivity slider now uses the same blue right-side (`>=`) threshold highlight style as the human escalation score slider for consistent semantics.
- Skill and KB similarity matching now use inclusive threshold checks (`>=`) to match the sensitivity slider semantics.
- Human escalation labels now use `Bot mesajı` / `Bot message` in AI Settings and Skills read-only preview (replacing `Asistan Sözü` / `Assistant's Promise`).

### Changed
- Changed lead-extraction status semantics: insufficient-information business turns now normalize to `undetermined` (score capped low), while `ignored` is preserved for non-business conversations only.
- Changed lead-status visual mapping to include a dedicated purple treatment for `undetermined` chips/dots in Inbox, Admin dashboard recent leads, and Leads table badges.
- Changed lead extraction prompt context to include recent role-labeled conversation turns (`customer`, `owner`, `assistant`) while preserving the latest-5 customer-message grounding window for extracted facts and scoring signals.
- Changed lead extraction locale precedence to `preferred locale > organization locale > message heuristics`; manual Inbox lead refresh now sends active UI locale to extraction.
- Changed inbound extraction locale wiring to avoid forcing per-message language when organization locale is available, improving TR consistency for mixed-message conversations.
- Changed `qualy-lp` footer scoring item semantics from lead scoring to testimonials by updating copy (`Testimonials` / `Müşteri Yorumları`) and retargeting anchor navigation to `/#testimonials`.
- Changed `qualy-lp` footer structure to remove Resources and Company columns, keeping only Product and Legal groups.
- Changed `qualy-lp` Product footer links to section-aware smooth-scroll behavior on homepage and `/#section` fallback navigation from other routes.
- Changed auth messenger preview spacing density: reduced message stack gap, reduced thread viewport height/padding, and reduced thread-to-composer top margin for a tighter chat/composer rhythm.
- Changed Inbox tab indicator behavior to show `(●)` when unread exists instead of unread count in tab title.
- Changed runtime branding text from the legacy product name to `Qualy` in document metadata and shared EN/TR common app labels.
- Changed app favicon pipeline to use `icon-black.svg` via locale metadata icons and app-level `src/app/icon.svg`; removed legacy `src/app/favicon.ico`.
- Changed Telegram/WhatsApp/Instagram brand icons to Remix fill set (`RiTelegramFill`, `RiWhatsappFill`, `RiInstagramFill`) for consistent channel visuals across Channels, Inbox, and Leads.
- Changed desktop main sidebar `Settings` target from `/settings` to `/settings/ai` so desktop opens AI settings directly while mobile quick menu keeps `/settings` list-first flow.
- Changed route prefetch warmups in `MainSidebar`, `SettingsResponsiveShell`, and `MobileBottomNav` to run with a short delayed schedule instead of immediate mount bursts.
- Changed Channels summary count and bot-mode copy to include Instagram as a first-class channel alongside Telegram/WhatsApp.
- Changed WhatsApp and Instagram channel-connect modals from manual credential forms to Meta OAuth authorization flow (no hand-entered access token fields in UI).
- Changed channel platform icon set to filled WhatsApp/Instagram variants and aligned icon usage across Channels, Inbox, and Leads.
- Changed auth forms to remove the in-form Sign In/Sign Up segmented switcher and rely on route-level pages plus footer links.
- Changed auth header branding scale by reducing `/logo-black.svg` size for a lighter top bar.
- Changed auth canvas flow to 3 clearly distinct two-turn scenarios instead of semantically chained conversations.
- Changed auth preview conversation lifecycle to keep 4 bubbles visible per scenario (`user, agent, user, agent`) before scenario switch.
- Changed auth composer disabled state to remain single-line and only expand vertically during `Sending...` feedback.
- Changed auth scoring predictions to start only after the first customer message (no pre-message score prediction shown).
- Changed auth top-left scoring chip to render an initial waiting placeholder state before first customer message (`Waiting/Bekleniyor`, pending score/signal).
- Changed auth scoring UI from below-composer panel to a compact internal-analysis chip under the top-left canvas text block with score/status/progress/signal.
- Changed auth preview to remove the duplicate scoring card under the composer and keep a single scoring surface in the top-left analysis chip.
- Changed auth score bar to an explicit 0-100 progress visualization with stronger hot-status emphasis.
- Changed auth customer bubbles to include explicit role labels (`Customer` / `Müşteri`) for simulation clarity.
- Changed auth canvas to include dynamic score/signal updates after each message (2 hot scenarios, 1 cold scenario).
- Changed support-only cold scenario closing message to concise handoff copy (“request forwarded to support”).
- Changed Sign Up consent row spacing/typography to keep the legal-acceptance sentence on one line on desktop while preserving mobile wrapping.
- Changed auth sending behavior so composer text remains visible during `Sending...`, then resets to placeholder-style empty input after send confirmation.
- Changed auth messenger preview with a short send-delay animation before promoting typed text into the sent user bubble.
- Changed auth composer sizing to a compact single-line presentation with subtle animated density transition.
- Changed auth right-panel preview alignment so the chat interaction block sits closer to vertical center.
- Changed auth messenger preview sequence to send-first timing: customer composes message, message is sent, composer resets, and then Qualy response types in.
- Changed auth right-panel visual from static prompt card to a dynamic messenger preview with top/bottom gradient composer accents and staged message transitions.
- Changed auth preview conversation thread to a capped internal-scroll viewport with hidden scrollbar and top gradient cut, preventing auth layout growth on long previews.
- Changed auth preview bubble stack alignment to bottom-anchor directly above the composer so new/active messages stay near input.
- Changed auth preview thread to fixed/clamped viewport height so the 4th bubble fades/clips at top on shorter desktop heights instead of pushing the canvas.
- Changed auth incoming bubble motion to use smooth enter animation plus typing-height reservation, reducing jitter while bot text appears.
- Changed auth thread/composer spacing so multi-line bot bubbles no longer touch the input/composer area.
- Changed Forgot Password and Reset Password pages to match Sign In/Sign Up visual system (removed nested inner-card wrapper, ink-accent input focus, CTA/link styling, and reset-form password visibility toggles).
- Changed Sign Up input scope to the MVP set (`full_name`, `email`, `password`, consent) and removed the visible company-name input from the form.
- Changed auth page structure to explicitly separate Sign In and Sign Up routes (`/login`, `/register`) and cross-link via footer actions.
- Changed system-admin active organization resolution to default slim mode (active org only) during route transitions; full org list now loads lazily when the sidebar picker opens.
- Changed desktop `MainSidebar` prefetch warmup to include core workspace/AI/admin routes in addition to settings destinations.
- Changed admin organization switcher UX from always-open inline list to compact summary + modal picker to reduce sidebar noise.
- Changed skill-testing scope to simulator-first in product docs (no separate per-skill playground planned for MVP).
- Changed roadmap/PRD admin scope tracking to reflect completed dashboard recent-leads wiring and platform-admin lead-list flow.
- Changed main sidebar Settings entry target from `/settings/channels` to `/settings` to reduce first-load weight and keep navigation app-like.
- Changed Inbox conversation-list header surface from white to the same muted panel tone as the rest of the list column for visual consistency.
- Simulator chat UI now uses a neutral chatbot surface (channel-agnostic header, message pane, and bubble styles) instead of WhatsApp-like wallpaper/green header/read ticks.
- Changed Next.js locale interception file convention from `src/middleware.ts` to `src/proxy.ts` to align with Next.js 16.
- Changed locale layout to remove the unused Material Symbols webfont `<link>` and keep shell font loading warning-free.
- Changed Knowledge document post-processing to pass bounded context into suggestion generators instead of full raw document bodies.
- Replaced broad `any` usage with concrete/unknown-safe typing patterns in core runtime paths (fallback, follow-up, AI settings, usage, inbox actions, knowledge actions, extraction, offering profile, telegram client).
- Updated `scripts/tests/main-sidebar.test.js` into a proper Vitest suite and aligned chat style exports with existing tests.
- Leads desktop table now keeps `Durum` chips on a single line and truncates long contact names to one line for cleaner row height consistency.
- Settings route composition now uses a shared `settings/layout.tsx` shell so desktop navigation keeps the inner settings sidebar mounted while only detail content updates.
- Lead extraction summary persistence now stays aligned with the current extraction window (latest 5 customer messages) instead of carrying over stale summaries when the latest extraction omits summary.
- Lead extraction strict-retry validation now requires `summary` together with `score` and `status` keys.
- Shadow-mode inbox inactive banner copy is now compact (`Yapay zeka asistanı devrede değil.` + `Dinleyici modunda yanıt gönderilmez.`) with reduced card footprint.
- Inbox scroll-to-latest CTA is now anchored on the composer divider and restyled with a subtle gray tone for clearer but less distracting visibility.
- Inbox composer spacing between the summary row and assistant banner is now tighter.
- Knowledge Base mobile edit header now uses compact copy (`Düzenle`, `Kaydet`) and hides back text (icon-only) to match Skills-style density.
- Skills detail header action buttons now use standardized delete/save icon + label patterns (desktop/mobile compatible).
- Mobile Skills detail header now uses shorter labels (`Düzenle`, `Kaydet`) to reduce top-bar crowding; desktop labels are unchanged.
- Mobile bottom navbar now prefetches main destinations on mount, reducing perceived delay when switching tabs.
- Mobile “Diğer > Ayarlar” shortcut now opens `/settings` (settings list landing) instead of jumping directly to Channels.

### Fixed
- Fixed profile-only service hallucination in greeting-only conversations (for example, `Hello`) by nulling inferred `service_type` unless customer text contains a concrete service clue.
- Fixed Inbox conversation-list lead-chip drift by syncing row status on manual refresh/realtime lead updates, including `ignored` (`Yok sayıldı`).
- Fixed TR UI extraction refresh mismatch where lead summary/details could remain English after Turkish UI-triggered refreshes.
- Fixed Netlify deep-link 404s for landing legal routes by adding SPA redirect fallback (`public/_redirects` with `/* /index.html 200`), so direct visits to `/legal`, `/terms`, and `/privacy` resolve correctly.
- Fixed Meta OAuth status/error redirects to use the active request origin for Channels-page return, preventing unexpected fallback to legacy Netlify domain URLs.
- Fixed Meta OAuth route host resolution drift on Netlify by using canonical app URL/forwarded-host resolution for both start and callback routes.
- Fixed opaque OAuth callback failures by attaching compact `meta_oauth_error` hints to `connect_failed` redirects.
- Fixed popup OAuth handoff dropping `meta_oauth_error`; main Channels URL now preserves the callback error hint after popup closes.
- Fixed WhatsApp connect failures caused by Graph error `(#100) Tried accessing nonexisting field (whatsapp_business_accounts) on node type (User)` by adding business-edge fallback queries.
- Fixed Meta OAuth status redirects to always return to a safe channel-settings URL (`returnTo`) so failed OAuth/env states no longer strand users on non-matching paths.
- Fixed mixed channel icon rendering inconsistencies by unifying Telegram/WhatsApp/Instagram under Remix fill variants (`RiTelegramFill`, `RiWhatsappFill`, `RiInstagramFill`).
- Fixed perceived navigation stalls during active interactions by deferring bulk prefetch calls with a short delayed schedule.
- Fixed Sign In and Sign Up page CTA styling so primary submit buttons and auth switch links now use the ink accent `#242A40` instead of blue.
- Fixed slow-feeling system-admin navigation caused by full organization-list reads on each route transition in dashboard context resolution.
- Fixed admin sub-route blank-wait transitions by adding explicit loading skeletons (organizations/users/detail pages) with immediate visual feedback.
- Fixed Next.js server/client serialization errors on admin dashboard (`Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components`) by rendering stat cards server-side instead of passing icon components through `StatCard` props from a server route.
- Fixed Inbox false-empty list states by adding a resilient fallback path in `getConversations`: when nested relational reads fail, the server now returns base conversations plus best-effort message/lead/assignee previews via flat per-table queries.
- Fixed noisy admin dashboard runtime error overlay by downgrading expected totals-RPC fallback logging from error-level to graceful fallback logs.
- Fixed slow-feeling settings transitions by removing a redundant auth read in settings layout and warming settings routes in advance.
- Fixed stale-closure risk in unsaved-changes save flow by including `transformPendingHref` in `useUnsavedChangesGuard` callback dependencies.
- Fixed failing inbox style tests by restoring `getInboxOutgoingBubbleClasses` export.
- Fixed Vitest failure caused by a non-suite test file (`scripts/tests/main-sidebar.test.js`) by converting it into an executable test suite.
- Fixed React hook rule violations (`rules-of-hooks`, `set-state-in-effect`) in Knowledge, Settings, and Auth flows.
- Fixed build-time type regressions introduced by strict typing updates (channel debug result narrowing, inbox optimistic message typing, dropdown clone typing).
- Desktop Settings sub-page navigation no longer flashes/replaces the whole settings shell with skeletons; sidebar remains stable while detail pane loads.
- Mobile Settings detail→list back navigation no longer behaves like a full refresh; it now returns via client-side transition for a stable mobile flow.
- Inbox conversation list header no longer shows a dropdown chevron next to the “Gelen Kutusu / Inbox” title.
- Inbox summary panel now regenerates summary on every reopen; manual refresh is no longer required after close/reopen.
- Fixed inbox conversation switching flicker by tracking selected-thread vs loaded-thread state and showing skeletons until selected-thread messages hydrate, so avatars/details no longer jump ahead of message content.
- Telegram webhook skill-matching failures now fail open to KB/fallback processing, preventing silent no-reply drops when embedding/match calls error.
- Telegram webhook AI gating no longer gets blocked by stale `assignee_id` when `active_agent` is already bot; runtime operator-active checks now honor `active_agent` as source of truth.
- Hot-lead `notify_only` escalation now preserves ongoing AI replies as intended (only `switch_to_operator` silences AI).
- Supabase migration version collision: renamed `00020_send_operator_message_rpc.sql` to `00052_send_operator_message_rpc.sql` so `schema_migrations.version` is unique.
- i18n hardcoded-string violations for simulator platform fallback labels in Inbox/Leads and static summary panel id attribute usage.
- Platform admin dashboard stat cards now use a single DB aggregate RPC instead of loading full organization summaries for global totals.
- Platform admin organization list now avoids in-memory full-list filtering/pagination by using DB-backed count + ranged queries.
- Platform admin organization aggregates now use batched reads instead of per-organization N+1 fan-out, and organization detail now loads targeted org/member/profile slices.
- Platform admin user list no longer triggers heavy organization summary aggregation; it now uses lightweight org identity lookups.
- Platform admin user detail now loads targeted profile/membership/organization slices instead of scanning full user+org read models.
- Removed unused `NavIconComponent` type in `MainSidebar` to keep admin-related lint checks clean.

  - **Inbox:** Implemented lazy loading (infinite scroll) for conversations.
  - **Inbox:** Added "Delete Conversation" functionality with cascading database deletes.
  - **Inbox:** UI improvements (message previews, simplified list items).

### Added
- **v0.5.0: Knowledge Base Parity**
  - **Simulator RAG Fallback:** Implemented RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in the `ChatSimulator`. It now falls back to the Knowledge Base (OpenAI + Embeddings) if no skill matches, mirroring the production Telegram behavior.
  - **Documentation:** Updated PRD and Roadmap to reflect current status.

### Added
- **v0.4.0: Active Agent & Realtime Inbox**
  - **Explicit Active State**: Added `active_agent` column ('bot' | 'operator') to prevent AI interference.
  - **Double-Lock Logic**: AI is now blocked if `active_agent === 'operator'` OR `assignee_id` is present.
  - **Assignee System**: Operators can "Claim" conversations; replying automatically assigns the user.
  - **Realtime Updates**: Enabled `supabase_realtime` for instant message delivery and inbox sorting.
  - **Optimistic UI**: Instant feedback on send, with "temp" message deduplication logic.
  - **Inbox Polish**: Robust auto-scroll, "Unassigned" filters, and simplified Details Panel (Status/Platform icons refined).
